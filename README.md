## Getting Started üîß

Here's how to get started with react-native-audio-waveform in your React Native project:

### Installation

##### 1. Install the package

```sh
npm install @simform_solutions/react-native-audio-waveform react-native-gesture-handler
```

###### --- or ---

```sh
yarn add @simform_solutions/react-native-audio-waveform react-native-gesture-handler
```

##### 2. Install CocoaPods in the iOS project

```bash
npx pod-install
```

##### Know more about [react-native-gesture-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler)

##### 3. Add audio recording permissions

##### iOS

If you want to use recorder features in iOS, you have to add **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** permission in info.plist and add a description based on your use case.

Here is a sample for info.plist permission and a description.

```
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Needed permission to record audio</string>
```

##### Android

If you want to use recorder features in Android, you have to add **RECORD_AUDIO** permission in AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```

### Usage

#### 1. Static waveform

When you want to show a waveform for a pre-existing audio file, you need to use `static` mode for the waveform. We have provided type safety for forward ref so that if you pass the `static` mode then you can only access methods which are available for static mode other methods will reject promise.

Check the example below for more information.

```tsx
import {
  Waveform,
  type IWaveformRef,
} from '@simform_solutions/react-native-audio-waveform';

const path = ''; // path to the audio file for which you want to show waveform
const ref = useRef<IWaveformRef>(null);
<Waveform
  mode="static"
  ref={ref}
  path={item}
  candleSpace={2}
  candleWidth={4}
  scrubColor="white"
  onPlayerStateChange={playerState => console.log(playerState)}
  onPanStateChange={isMoving => console.log(isMoving)}
/>;
```

#### 2. Live recording waveform

When you want to record audio and show a waveform for that recording, you need to create a waveform with `live` mode. Same as `static` mode, we have safety for ref methods.

Check the example below for more information.

```tsx
import {
  Waveform,
  type IWaveformRef,
} from '@simform_solutions/react-native-audio-waveform';

const ref = useRef<IWaveformRef>(null);
<Waveform
  mode="live"
  ref={ref}
  candleSpace={2}
  candleWidth={4}
  onRecorderStateChange={recorderState => console.log(recorderState)}
/>;
```

You can check out the full example at [Example](./example/src/App.tsx).

#### IWaveformRef Methods

#### For Static mode

#### startPlayer()

```ts
startPlayer({
    finishMode?: FinishMode;
}): Promise<boolean>
```

starts playing the audio with the specified finish mode. If finish mode is not specified, it will default to `FinishMode.stop`.

It returns a boolean indicating whether playback is started.

#### stopPlayer()

```ts
stopPlayer(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns a boolean indicating whether playback is stopped.

#### pausePlayer()

```ts
pausePlayer(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns a boolean indicating whether playback is paused.

#### resumePlayer()

```ts
resumePlayer(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns a boolean indicating whether playback is resumed again.

#### stopAllPlayers()

```ts
stopAllPlayers(): Promise<boolean>
```

Stops all the players at once and frees their native resources. Useful on unmount!
It returns a boolean indicating that all players were stopped.

#### stopAllWaveFormExtractors()

```ts
stopAllWaveFormExtractors(): Promise<boolean>
```

Stops all the extractors used to build the audio waveform and frees its native resource. Useful on unmount!
It returns a boolean indicating that all extractors were stopped.

#### stopPlayersAndExtractors()

```ts
stopPlayersAndExtractors(): Promise<[boolean, boolean]>
```

Combined the `stopAllWaveFormExtractors` and `stopAllPlayers` in one call to free up the maximum possible resources. Very useful on unmount!
It returns an array of two booleans indicating if all players and all waveform extractors were stopped.

#### For Live mode

#### startRecord()

```ts
startRecord({
    encoder:number;
    sampleRate: number;
    bitRate: number;
    fileNameFormat: string;
    useLegacy: boolean;
    updateFrequency?: UpdateFrequency;
}): Promise<boolean>
```

Start a new audio recording with the given parameters. It will return whether the recording was started or not.

Check [UpdateFrequency](#updatefrequency) to know more.

> Note: Before starting the recording, the user must allow **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** for iOS. You can check the permissions by using **_checkHasAudioRecorderPermission_** from **_useAudioPermission_**. Check [useAudioPermission](#useaudiopermission-hook) to know more about various methods.

#### stopRecord()

```ts
stopRecord(): Promise<string>
```

It returns a string representing the current recorded audio file path.

#### pauseRecord()

```ts
pauseRecord(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns a boolean indicating whether the recording is paused.

#### resumeRecord()

```ts
resumeRecord(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns a boolean indicating whether the recording is resumed again.

### useAudioPermission hook

By using this hook, you can check and ask for permission from the user for **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** permission.

#### checkHasAudioRecorderPermission()

This method checks whether the user has permission to use a microphone for recording new audio. It will return [PermissionStatus](#permissionstatus).

You can use this method as shown below:

```ts
const hasPermission: PermissionStatus = await checkHasAudioRecorderPermission();
```

#### getAudioRecorderPermission()

This method lets you ask for **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** permission from the user. It will return PermissionStatus.

By combining this with checkHasAudioRecorderPermission you can ask for permission and start recording if permission is granted.

Check out the following example:

```ts
let hasPermission = await checkHasAudioRecorderPermission();

if (hasPermission === PermissionStatus.granted) {
  startRecording();
} else if (hasPermission === PermissionStatus.undetermined) {
  const permissionStatus = await getAudioRecorderPermission();
  if (permissionStatus === PermissionStatus.granted) {
    startRecording();
  }
} else {
  Linking.openSettings();
}
```

#### PlayerState

```ts
enum PlayerState {
  playing = 'playing',
  paused = 'paused',
  stopped = 'stopped',
}
```

#### RecorderState

```ts
enum RecorderState {
  recording = 'recording',
  paused = 'paused',
  stopped = 'stopped',
}
```

#### UpdateFrequency

```ts
// Update frequency in milliseconds
enum UpdateFrequency {
  high = 250.0,
  medium = 500.0,
  low = 1000.0,
}
```

#### PermissionStatus

```ts
enum PermissionStatus {
  denied = 'denied',
  undetermined = 'undetermined',
  granted = 'granted',
}
```

## Example

You can check out the example app for react-native-audio-waveform in [Example](./example/src/App.tsx)

To use example app you need to first run below command

```bash
cd example && npx react-native-asset
```

> Note: If link-assets-manifest.json file already exists then make sure to delete that before running npx react-native-asset command.

This command will add our example audio sample files to the iOS bundle so that we can access them inside the iOS app.

```sh
yarn
yarn example ios // For iOS
yarn example android // For Android
```
