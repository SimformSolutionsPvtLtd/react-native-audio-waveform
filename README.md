## Getting Started 🔧

Here's how to get started with react-native-audio-waveform in your React Native project:

### Installation

##### 1. Install the package

```sh
npm install react-native-audio-waveform react-native-gesture-handler
```

###### --- or ---

```sh
yarn add react-native-audio-waveform  react-native-gesture-handler
```

##### 2. Install cocoapods in the ios project

```bash
npx pod-install
```

##### Know more about [react-native-gesture-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler)

##### 3. Add Permission in iOS

if you want to use recorder features in iOS side you have to add **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** permission in info.plist and add description based on your use-case.

here is a sample for info.plist permission and description

```plist
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
 <string>Needed permission to record audio</string>
```

### Usage

#### 1. Static waveform

When you want to show a waveform for pre-existing audio file you need to use `static` mode for the waveform. We have provided type safety for forward ref so that if you pass the `static` mode then you can only assign ref type of `IPlayWaveformRef` to the waveform.

Check below example for more information.

```tsx
import { IPlayWaveformRef, Waveform } from 'react-native-audio-waveform';

const path = ''; // path to the audio file for which you want to show waveform
const ref = useRef<IPlayWaveformRef>(null);
<Waveform<'static'>
  mode="static"
  ref={ref}
  path={item}
  candleSpace={2}
  candleWidth={4}
  scrubColor="white"
  onPlayerStateChange={playerState => console.log(playerState)}
  onPanStateChange={isMoving => console.log(isMoving)}
/>;
```

#### 2. Live recording waveform

When you are want to record a audio and show waveform that recording at that time you need to create waveform with `live` mode. Same as `static` mode we have type safety for ref. You can only provide `IRecordWaveformRef` to `live` mode waveform.

Check below example for more information.

```tsx
import { IRecordWaveformRef, Waveform } from 'react-native-audio-waveform';

const ref = useRef<IRecordWaveformRef>(null);
<Waveform<'live'>
  mode="live"
  ref={ref}
  candleSpace={2}
  candleWidth={4}
  onRecorderStateChange={recorderState => console.log(recorderState)}
/>;
```

you can check full example at [Example](./example/src/App.tsx).

### Methods

#### IPlayWaveformRef methods

#### startPlayer()

```ts
startPlayer({
  finishMode?: FinishMode;
}): Promise<boolean>
```

starts playing the audio with the specified finish mode. If finish mode is not specified it will defaults to `FinishMode.stop`.

It returns boolean indicating whether playback is started.

#### stopPlayer()

```ts
stopPlayer(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns boolean indicating whether playback is stopped.

#### pausePlayer()

```ts
pausePlayer(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns boolean indicating whether playback is paused.

#### resumePlayer()

```ts
resumePlayer(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns boolean indicating whether playback is resumed again.

#### IRecordWaveformRef methods

#### startRecord()

```ts
startRecord({
  encoder: number;
  sampleRate: number;
  bitRate: number;
  fileNameFormat: string;
  useLegacy: boolean;
  updateFrequency?: UpdateFrequency;
}): Promise<boolean>;
```

Start a new audio recording with given parameters. It will return the if recording was started or not.

Check [UpdateFrequency](#updatefrequency) to know more.

> Note: Before starting the recording, User must have to allow **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** for iOS. You can check the permissions by using **_checkHasAudioRecorderPermission_** from **_useAudioPermission_**. Check [useAudioPermission](#useaudiopermission-hook) to know more about various methods.

#### stopRecord()

```ts
stopRecord(): Promise<string>
```

It returns string representing the current recorded audio file path.

#### pauseRecord()

```ts
pauseRecord(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns boolean indicating whether recording is paused.

#### resumeRecord()

```ts
resumeRecord(): Promise<boolean>
```

It returns boolean indicating whether recording is resumed again.

### useAudioPermission hook

By using this hook you can check and ask for permission from user for **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** permission.

#### checkHasAudioRecorderPermission()

This method checks whether user has permission to use Microphone for recording new audio. It will return [PermissionStatus](#permissionstatus).

you can use this method as shown below:

```ts
const hasPermission: PermissionStatus = await checkHasAudioRecorderPermission();
```

#### getAudioRecorderPermission()

This method lets you ask for **NSMicrophoneUsageDescription** permission from user. It will return PermissionStatus.

By combining this and checkHasAudioRecorderPermission you can ask for permission and start recording if permission is granted.

Check the following example for example:

```ts
let hasPermission: PermissionStatus = await checkHasAudioRecorderPermission();

if (hasPermission === PermissionStatus.granted) {
  startRecording();
} else if (hasPermission === PermissionStatus.undetermined) {
  const permissionStatus = await getAudioRecorderPermission();
  if (permissionStatus === PermissionStatus.granted) {
    startRecording();
  }
} else {
  Linking.openSettings();
}
```

---

#### PlayerState

```ts
enum PlayerState {
  playing = 'playing',
  paused = 'paused',
  stopped = 'stopped',
}
```

#### RecorderState

```ts
enum RecorderState {
  recording = 'recording',
  paused = 'paused',
  stopped = 'stopped',
}
```

#### UpdateFrequency

```ts
// Update frequency in milliseconds
enum UpdateFrequency {
  high = 250.0,
  medium = 500.0,
  low = 1000.0,
}
```

#### PermissionStatus

```ts
enum PermissionStatus {
  denied = 'denied',
  undetermined = 'undetermined',
  granted = 'granted',
}
```

---

## Example

you check out the example app for react-native-audio-waveform in [Example](./example/src/App.tsx)

To use example app you need to first run below

```bash
cd example && npx react-native-asset
```

This command will our example audio sample files to iOS bundle so that we can access them inside iOS app.

```sh
yarn
yarn example ios   // For ios
yarn example android   // For Android
```
